== Welcome to Moflix

Moflix was my final project for the General Assembly Web Development Intensive (WDI) course in Dec '13 - Mar '14.

The idea is for users to be able to create a slideshow of photographs and associated comments/conversations stored on social media accounts and set this to a music track of their choosing. Once created, the slideshow can be viewed and shared with friends.

Moflix currently connects to photographs and conversations using the Facebook and Instagram APIS. Music tracks are provided via the YouTube API.
